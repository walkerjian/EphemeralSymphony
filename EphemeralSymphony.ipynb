        "Weâ€™ll need to clearly define **Generative Polymorphism** in contrast to existing forms of polymorphism (ad-hoc, parametric, and subtype). The key differentiator here is that generative polymorphism involves **dynamic code or behavior generation** at runtime, rather than statically defined overloads or type parameters.\n",

        "- Context: Use cases for generative polymorphism in AI-enhanced systems or dynamic, context-driven runtime environments.\n",
        "- Examples: Real-world examples of generative behavior, even if implicit, to show how AI-based systems like language models or adaptive software might use generative polymorphism.\n",

        "In this paper, we introduce the concept of **Generative Polymorphism**, an emerging form of polymorphism that enables dynamic generation of code or behavior at runtime, based on abstract input and contextual awareness. Unlike traditional polymorphism, which relies on pre-defined overloads, inheritance, or generics, **Generative Polymorphism** enables systems to create new implementations in response to real-time inputs, environmental changes, and stochastic phenomena. This paradigm is further expanded with the notion of **Endochronic Generative Polymorphism**, where code is generated in anticipation of its execution or evolves during runtime as the system interacts with a non-stationary environment. We explore the theoretical foundations of this approach, its relationship to traditional polymorphism, and its applications in AI-assisted programming, autonomous systems, and self-adaptive software.\n",
